# Review flagged skills

1. Read `~/.claude/skill-router/profile.json` and take its `cleanup` list. If it is empty or missing, say there is nothing to review and stop.
2. Show one table: skill, which skill covers it (`keep`), the reason, and where it lives (`source`).
3. Explain what can be done for each source:
   - `user` or `project`: the folder in `dir` can be moved to `~/.claude/skills-archive/` (reversible: move it back).
   - `plugin:<id>`: single plugin skills cannot be removed. Only suggest `claude plugin disable <id>` if every skill of that plugin is redundant, and say what else the plugin provides.
   - `synced`: managed by claude.ai; leave it.
4. Ask the user which ones to apply. Change nothing they did not approve.
5. For approved `user`/`project` skills, move the folder into `~/.claude/skills-archive/` and report each move. A project skill that is tracked by git is a repo change: say so before moving it.
6. Tell the user the router re-tunes itself automatically at the next session start, because the skill set changed.
